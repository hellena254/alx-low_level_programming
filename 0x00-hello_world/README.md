# Hello World - C Programming Basics

This project is a collection of scripts and C programs designed to introduce you to the basic concepts of C programming. It covers topics such as preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and using essential C syntax.

## Prerequisite Learning Materials

Before diving into this project, it's recommended to have a good understanding of the following topics:

- C programming language basics
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Shell scripting fundamentals

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hellena254/alx-low_level_programming.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd 0x00-hello_world
3. Execute the scripts and compile the C programs following the task instructions.

## Task 0: Preprocessor
- Script: `preprocessor.sh`
- Description: This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
- Usage: `./preprocessor.sh input.c output.c`

## Task 1: Compiler
- Script: `compiler.sh`
- Description: This script compiles a C file but does not link it.
- Usage: `./compiler.sh input.c output.o`

## Task 2: Assembler
- Script: `assembler.sh`
- Description: This script generates the assembly code of a C file and saves it in an output file.
- Usage: `./assembler.sh input.c output.s`

## Task 3: Name
- Script: `name.sh`
- Description: This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named "cisfun."
- Usage: `./name.sh input.c`

## Task 4: Hello, puts
- File: `hello_puts.c`
- Description: This C program prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" using the `puts` function.
- Usage: `./hello_puts`

## Task 5: Hello, printf
- File: `hello_printf.c`
- Description: This C program prints a piece of art using the `printf` function.
- Usage: `./hello_printf`

## Task 6: Size is not grandeur
- File: `size.c`
- Description: This C program prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
- Usage: `./size`

## Task 7: Intel
- Script: `intel.sh`
- Description: This script generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C file and saves it in an output file.
- Usage: `./intel.sh input.c output.s` (input file name in $CFILE)

## Task 8: UNIX is basically a simple operating system
- File: `unix.c`
- Description: This C program prints a quote to the standard error.
- Usage: `./unix`
