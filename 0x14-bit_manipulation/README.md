# Bit Manipulation in C

## Introduction

Bit manipulation is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming. It involves performing operations on individual bits or groups of bits within binary numbers. In C, bit manipulation is often used to optimize code, control hardware devices, and solve various algorithmic problems efficiently.

This README provides an overview of bit manipulation in C and references to learn more about this topic.

## Basic Bit Manipulation Operations

1. **Bitwise AND (`&`):** Performs a bitwise AND operation between two numbers, setting a bit to 1 if it is 1 in both operands.

2. **Bitwise OR (`|`):** Performs a bitwise OR operation between two numbers, setting a bit to 1 if it is 1 in either operand.

3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`):** Performs a bitwise XOR operation between two numbers, setting a bit to 1 if it is 1 in one operand but not both.

4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`):** Inverts each bit, changing 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.

5. **Left Shift (`<<`):** Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions, filling with zeros.

6. **Right Shift (`>>`):** Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions, filling with zeros (for unsigned) or the sign bit (for signed).

## Use Cases

Bit manipulation is useful in various scenarios, including:

- **Flags and Status Bits:** Storing multiple Boolean flags in a single variable.
- **Data Compression:** Encoding and decoding data efficiently.
- **Low-Level Hardware Control:** Manipulating hardware registers to control peripherals.
- **Algorithm Optimization:** Enhancing the performance of algorithms and data structures.
- **Packing and Unpacking:** Combining multiple values into a single value and extracting them when needed.
