#  C - Even More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

Welcome to the "Even More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings" project! This project delves deeper into your understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in C, including the concept of pointers to pointers and multidimensional arrays. Before tackling the tasks, ensure you have a grasp of the following topics:

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of pointers to pointers and how to use them.
- Knowledge of multidimensional arrays and their usage.
  
  Now, let's explore the tasks:

 ## Task 0: memset
 **Description:** 
 Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
 
 Used `memset`

 ## Task 1: memcpy
 **Description:**
 Write a function that copies a memory area.
 
 Used `memcpy`

 ## Task 2: strchr
 **Description:**
 Write a function that locates a character in a string.
 
 Used `strchr`

 ## Task 3: strspn
 **Description:**
 Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
 
 Used `strspn`

 ## Task 4: strpbrk
**Description:**
Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

Used `strpbrk`

## Task 5: strstr
**Description:**
Write a function that locates a substring.

Used `strstr`

## Task 6: ChessBoard
**Description:**

Write a function that prints the chessboard.

## Task 7: The Line of Life
**Description:**

Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

## Task 8: Double Pointer, Double Fun
**Description:**

Create a file that contains the password for the `crackme2` executable.

Your file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
`ltrace`, `ldd`, `gdb` and `objdump` can help

You may need to install the `openssl` library to run the `crakme2` program: `sudo apt install libssl-dev`
