# C - Functions, Nested Loops

Welcome to the "C - Functions, Nested Loops" project! This project contains a series of programming tasks aimed at practicing C programming concepts related to functions, loops, and various mathematical operations. Let's dive into each task and its description:

## Task 0: _putchar

**Description:**
Write a program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.

**Instructions:**
- Open the source code file for Task 0.
- Implement code to print `_putchar` followed by a newline character.
- Compile and run the program.

## Task 1: The Alphabet Game

**Description:**
Write a function `print_alphabet` that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**Prototype:** `void print_alphabet(void);`
- You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code.

## Task 2: 10 x Alphabet

**Description:**
Write a function `print_alphabet_x10` that prints the alphabet in lowercase ten times, followed by a new line.

**Prototype:** `void print_alphabet_x10(void);`
- You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code.

## Task 3: islower

**Description:**
Write a function `int _islower(int c)` that checks if a character is lowercase.

**Prototype:** `int _islower(int c);`
- Returns 1 if `c` is lowercase, 0 otherwise.

## Task 4: isalpha

**Description:**
Write a function `int _isalpha(int c)` that checks if a character is alphabetic.

**Prototype:** `int _isalpha(int c);`
- Returns 1 if `c` is a letter (lowercase or uppercase), 0 otherwise.

## Task 5: Sign

**Description:**
Write a function `int print_sign(int n)` that prints the sign of a number.

**Prototype:** `int print_sign(int n);`
- Returns 1 and prints `+` if `n` is greater than zero.
- Returns 0 and prints `0` if `n` is zero.
- Returns -1 and prints `-` if `n` is less than zero.

## Task 6: Absolute Value

**Description:**
Write a function `int _abs(int)` that computes the absolute value of an integer.

**Prototype:** `int _abs(int);`

## Task 7: Last Digit

**Description:**
Write a function `int print_last_digit(int)` that prints the last digit of a number.

**Prototype:** `int print_last_digit(int);`
- Returns the value of the last digit.

## Task 8: Jack Bauer

**Description:**
Write a function `void jack_bauer(void)` that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

**Prototype:** `void jack_bauer(void);`

## Task 9: Times Table

**Description:**
Write a function `void times_table(void)` that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

**Prototype:** `void times_table(void);`

## Task 10: Addition

**Description:**
Write a function `int add(int, int)` that adds two integers and returns the result.

**Prototype:** `int add(int, int);`

## Task 11: Print to 98

**Description:**
Write a function `void print_to_98(int n)` that prints all natural numbers from `n` to 98, followed by a new line.

**Prototype:** `void print_to_98(int n);`
- Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space.
- Numbers should be printed in order.
- The first printed number should be the number passed to your function.
- The last printed number should be 98.

## Task 12: Times Table (Part 2)

**Description:**
Write a function `void print_times_table(int n)` that prints the `n` times table, starting with 0.

**Prototype:** `void print_times_table(int n);`
- If `n` is greater than 15 or less than 0, the function should not print anything.

## Task 13: Sum of Multiples

**Description:**
Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

## Task 14: Fibonacci Numbers

**Description:**
Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

## Task 15: Even Fibonacci Sum

**Description:**
Write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, followed by a new line.

## Task 16: More Fibonacci Numbers

**Description:**
Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line. The numbers should be separated by commas.

**Note:** You are not allowed to use long long, malloc, pointers, arrays/tables, or structures.

Feel free to explore and practice these programming tasks. Happy coding!
