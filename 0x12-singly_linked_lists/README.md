# Singly Linked List in C

A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure used in programming to organize and manage a collection of elements, where each element, or "node," consists of two parts:

1. Data: This holds the actual value or information you want to store.
2. Pointer (or Reference): This points to the next node in the list, creating a sequence of nodes.

## Common Use Cases

Singly linked lists have several common use cases, including:

1. **Dynamic Data Structures:** Singly linked lists can dynamically grow or shrink, making them ideal for scenarios with variable data sizes.

2. **Insertion and Deletion:** Efficient for inserting or deleting elements at the beginning or end of the list due to minimal pointer updates.

3. **Implementing Stacks and Queues:** Singly linked lists serve as the underlying data structure for both stacks and queues.

4. **Memory Management:** Used in memory allocation systems to manage free memory blocks.

5. **Traversal:** Easily iterate through a collection by following links from one node to the next.

## Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};

int main() {
    // Create and manipulate a singly linked list of integers.
    // ... (See code example in the project folder for details)
    return 0;
}
```

The provided C code demonstrates how to create, populate, and traverse a singly linked list.

## Note

When working with singly linked lists, it's essential to manage memory properly by allocating and deallocating resources using functions like `malloc` and `free`.
