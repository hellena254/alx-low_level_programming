# C Programming Basics

This C programming project covers fundamental concepts and tasks related to arithmetic operators, logical operators, relational operators, boolean operators, conditional statements (if and if...else), comments, variable declaration and assignment, variable printing, loops (specifically while loops), and various programming exercises.
## 0. Positive or Negative

- **Description:** This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it's executed and prints whether the number stored in `n` is positive or negative.
- **File:** `0-positive_or_negative.c`

## 1. The Last Digit

- **Description:** This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it's executed.
- **File:** `1-last_digit.c`

## 2. The Alphabet Game

- **Description:** This program prints the lowercase alphabet, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function.
- **File:** `2-print_alphabet.c`

## 3. alphABET

- **Description:** This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function.
- **File:** `3-print_alphabets.c`

## 4. Alphabet Soup

- **Description:** This program prints the lowercase alphabet, followed by a new line, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', using only the `putchar` function.
- **File:** `4-print_alphabet_no_qe.c`

## 5. Numbers

- **Description:** This program prints all single-digit numbers in base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- **File:** `5-print_numbers.c`

## 6. Numberz

- **Description:** This program prints all single-digit numbers in base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function and without using variables of type `char`.
- **File:** `6-print_numberz.c`

## 7. Smile in the Mirror

- **Description:** This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function.
- **File:** `7-print_tebahpla.c`

## 8. Hexadecimal

- **Description:** This program prints all numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function.
- **File:** `8-print_base16.c`

## 9. Combinations

- **Description:** This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
- **File:** `9-print_comb.c`

## Task 10: Combinations of Two Digits

 - **Description:** Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
 - **File:** `100-print_comb3.c`

## Task 11: Combinations of Three Digits

 - **Description:** Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
 - **File:** `101-print_comb4.c`

## Task 12: Combinations of Two Two-Digit Numbers

 - **Description:** Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
 - **File:** `102-print_comb5.c`
