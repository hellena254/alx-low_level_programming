Welcome to the "More Functions, More Nested Loops" project! This project includes various programming tasks to enhance your C programming skills. Let's explore each task with its description and instructions:

## Task 0: isupper

**Description:**
Write a function that checks for an uppercase character.

## Task 1: isdigit

**Description:**
Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

## Task 2: Collaboration is Multiplication

**Description:**
Write a function `int mul(int a, int b)` that multiplies two integers.

## Task 3: The Numbers Speak for Themselves

**Description:**
Write a function `void print_numbers(void)` that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

## Task 4: I Believe in Numbers and Signs

**Description:**
Write a function `void print_most_numbers(void)` that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. However, do not print 2 and 4.

## Task 5: Numbers Constitute the Only Universal Language

**Description:**
Write a function `void more_numbers(void)` that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

## Task 6: The Shortest Distance Between Two Points is a Straight Line

**Description:**

**Description:**
Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

## Task 9: Fizz-Buzz

**Description:**
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz." For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."

## Task 10: Triangles

**Description:**
Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
