# More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

Welcome to the "More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings" project! This project builds on your understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in C. Before diving into the tasks,make sure you are familiar with the following prerequisites:

## Prerequisites
-  Understanding of pointers and how to use them.
-  Knowledge of arrays and their usage.
-  Awareness of the differences between pointers and arrays.
-  Ability to work with strings, including manipulation.
-  Understanding the scope of variables in C.

Now, let's explore the tasks:

 1. `strcat`: Write a function that concatenates two strings.
 2. `strncat`: Write a function that concatenates two strings.
 3. `strncpy`: Write a function that copies a string.
 4. `strcmp`: Write a function that compares two strings.
 5. `4-rev_array.c` Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
 6. `5-string_toupper.c` Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
 7. `6: 6-cap_string.c:` Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
 8. **Mozart Composed His Music:** Write a function that encodes a string into "1337" (leet) language.
 9. **rot13:** Write a function that encodes a string using the rot13 algorithm.
 10. `101-print_number.c` Write a function that prints an integer.
 11. `102-magic.c` Add one line to the provided code so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.
 12. `103-infinite_add.c` Write a function that adds two numbers.
 13. `104-print_buffer.c` Write a function that prints a buffer.
