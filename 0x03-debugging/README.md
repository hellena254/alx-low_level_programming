# C - Debugging

Welcome to the "C - Debugging" project! This project focuses on debugging C programs to ensure they work correctly. Let's go through each debugging task:

## Task 0: Multiple mains

**Description:**
Based on the `main.c` file provided, create a file named `0-main.c`. This file must test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

**Instructions:**
- You are not coding the solution/function; you're just testing it.
- You can adapt your function from "0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0" to compile with this main file to test locally.
- You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code; you may change only one line in this task.

## Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe

**Description:**
Copy the provided main file. Comment out (don't delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

## Task 2: 0 > 972?

**Description:**
This program prints the largest of three integers.

**Fix:** Modify the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

## Task 3: Leap year

**Description:**
This program converts a date to the day of the year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap years into consideration.

**Fix:** Modify the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

**Notes:**
- Line count will not be checked for this task.
- You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e., the value of `month` will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e., the value of `day` will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
- You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e., there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e., February 29, 1991, or February 29, 2427).

Feel free to explore and practice these debugging tasks. Happy coding!
